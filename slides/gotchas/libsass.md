## LibSass != Sass

* Development of Sass is in Ruby
* LibSass is behind Sass in features
* LibSass is faster, but limited

Note: LibSass is awesome, it can increase compile times, and remove the dependency on Ruby. The bad part about it though is that is is very behind on Sass as far as features. No maps (yet) nor silent extends (yet).
