## CDNs

* We are limited by the speed of light <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Put you're content closer to the user. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
This shouldn't be surprising, but the best way to fight latency is just to have a CDN. Get content as close to the user as possible, so each round trip is not as far.
