## It's not speed...

### It's latency <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
It would make sense that if we can just increase people's speed of connection, then our sites will load faster. The fact is though, lowering latency will effect the page load time much more than speed will. The graph on the left shows the page load time decreasing as we increase speed of the connection, but it hits a point of diminishing returns. The right graph shows the page load time as we decrease latency (RTT = Round Trip Time), where we have a specific linear connection.
