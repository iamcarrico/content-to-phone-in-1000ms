## Gemfile

A Gemfile will hold the base information on which gem version we can use on this project.

The Gemfile.lock holds the exact version of each gem that was utilized.

Both should be in version control.


Note: Gemfiles are course, they can say "at least this version", or "2.4.0 - 2.4.9". The Gemfile.lock holds the exact versions that were used in a project, and is generated by Bundler for you.
