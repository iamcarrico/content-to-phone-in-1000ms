## Install the correct gems

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## To install gems in your local directory

```bash
$ bundle install --path=.vendor/bundle
```

Note: Sometimes we do not have permission to install gems globally, and that is fine. We can install them into the project directory just by using the second line.
