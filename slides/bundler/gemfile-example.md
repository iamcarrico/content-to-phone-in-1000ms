## Gemfile Example

```ruby
source 'http://rubygems.org'
ruby '2.0.0'

gem 'sass', '~>3.3.0'
gem 'compass', '~>1.0.0.alpha.21'
gem 'toolkit', '~>2.3'
gem 'breakpoint', '~>2.4'
```

Note: This is the Gemfile for this slideshow. You can specify each gem you want, and which version you want to use. You can also specify which version of ruby you want, although it won't use different versions of ruby, it will only error out if you are not using the correct version.
