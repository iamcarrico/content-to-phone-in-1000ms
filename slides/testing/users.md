## Test to Your Users

* Your users are not you
* Test under the conditions that your users access the site.

Note:
Every set of users are unique, and they have different needs. Some sites user base all use Google Chrome Canary, and that site can always use the latest and greatest techniques for web performance. Other sites primarily have users that use IE 8, and must have a very different set of tools to ensure their performance is excellent. Before we go deep into what we can do, take a look at the needs of your particular users, and test under those conditions.
