## Why?

* Bounce rates increase <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Mental context switching happens after 1 second <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Many countries are mostly mobile devices <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* We cannot rely on 4G to fix the problem for us <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Google, Amazon, Bing and others have all done user tests on the effects of page load time on the user's experience, conversions and bounce rates. Not only do bounce rates increase after 1000ms (immensely), but the user's mental context switches after a second. This means they will start wondering if they left the oven on more than you're site's content. We especially need think about mobile devices because more and more users across the globe are using their mobile devices to access the web. Finally, we cannot rely on faster mobile speeds to solve the problem for us, because besides things like LTE not being rolled out everywhere in the globe, speed alone will not make our sites load faster.
