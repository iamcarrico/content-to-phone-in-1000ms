Note: Really, everybody must think performance while creating a web property. It should not be an afterthought, but something that is considered throughout the life cycle of a project. The performance engineer therefore must give the entire team the data they need to make the right choices. This means that the designers must be informed of the techniques to load pages (e.g. lazy-loading images). The development team must have automated testing so they can see the performance impact on all their decisions. This happens by having automated testing, and data recording / visualization.
